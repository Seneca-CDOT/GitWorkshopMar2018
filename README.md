# GitWorkshopFSOSS2018

The workshop for participants of the FSOSS conference is being held in room S2123 on the October 25 2018. It will start at 13:00 and go for two hours, until 15:00.

The workshop is intended for anyone who is new to Github, git, or version control in general. During the workshop, we will introduce concepts and terminology, create a repository, commit changes and handle conflicts.

Participants are free to use computers in the lab, but you will need a temporary account. If you choose to bring your own laptop you will need to install:

* git bash - or have access to command line git (https://git-scm.com/) 
* a text editor
